# General information
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The dataset provides resting-state EEG data (eyes open,partially eyes closed) from 71 participants who underwent two experiments involving normal sleep (NS---session1) and  sleep deprivation(SD---session2) .The dataset also provides information on participants' sleepiness and mood states.
（Please note here Session 1 (NS) and Session 2 (SD) is not the time order, the time order is counterbalanced across participants and is listed in metadata.）

The data collection was initiated in March 2019 and was terminated in December 2020. The detailed description of the dataset is currently under working by Chuqin Xiang,Xinrui Fan,Duo Bai,Ke Lv and Xu Lei, and will submit to Scientific Data for publication.
